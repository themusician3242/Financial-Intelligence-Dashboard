<h3><b>Financial Intelligence Dashboard</b></h3>

This repository contains a **static version** of the Financial Intelligence Dashboard.

**To run the interactive dashboard:**
- Download the project files.
- Open the folder in VSCode (or any IDE).
- Run using Live Server on Port 8080.

**Customization**

The dashboard was originally designed for my personal use, so many of the inputs are pre-filled with placeholder numbers. To tailor it to your own finances, update the following files and variables:

**globals.js**
- existingFHSA: Edit to reflect your TFSA, FHSA, or other savings account balances.
- existingRRSP: Edit to reflect your RRSP or 401(k) balances.

**update-financials.js**
- fixedCapital: The amount of money you currently have available (e.g., $1,900 in your chequing account).
